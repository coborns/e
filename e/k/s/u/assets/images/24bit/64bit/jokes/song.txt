Maybe I
Lost my mind
No one noticed
No one noticed
It's getting old (I'd kinda like it if you'd call me)
All alone ('cause I'm so over bein' lonely)
May have lost it (I need a virtual connection)
I have lost it (be my video obsession)
â™ª
No one tried
To read my eyes
No one but you
Wish it weren't true
Maybe I (I'd kinda like it if you'd call me)
It's not right ('cause I'm so over bein' lonely)
Make you mine (I need a virtual connection)
Take our time (be my video obsession)
Come on, don't leave me, it can't be that easy, babe
If you believe me, I guess I'll get on a plane
Fly to your city excited to see your face
Hold me, console me, and then I'll leave without a trace
Come on, don't leave me, it can't be that easy, babe
If you believe me, I guess I'll get on a plane
Fly to your city excited to see your face
Hold me, console me, then I'll leave without a trace
Come on, don't leave me, it can't be that easy, babe
If you believe me, I guess I'll get on a plane
Fly to your city excited to see your face
